# [FINAL CHALLENGE] Alura Data Science Immersion Week
## Machine Learning Model to Identify Potential New Drugs

**Objective:** The purpose of this mini-project is to learn how to filter and analyse a dataset, and use this data to train and test a machine learning model that can classify future inputs.

**Data:** The data used in this project comes from a Kaggle Challenge, and was adapted by the team who conducted the immersion week. The dataframes bring information about cell cultures treated with different drugs, and the results these drugs had on (1) gene expression and (2) cell viability.

**Analyses:** Analyses were conducted using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy e scikit-learn.

OBS: Even though the data was forked from another repository, 100% of the code was developed by me.
